# Well Formed - Accessible Webforms at your fingertips
### James McLean

## What is Well Formed
Well Formed is an application for generating accessible web forms. It features an easy to use interface to design forms and produces HTML form elements ready to be dropped into your web page. These elements are WCAG AAA compliant so will be compatible with screen readers and other descriptive accessibility tools.

This is my Honour's project - my final dissertation recieved a grade of 75%.

## Set up

Prerequisites:
- Node.js

Download the application folder and navigate to it in the file explorer or open it in a development application such as VSCode. Open a terminal window and run:

> npm start

Open a browser tab and navigate to localhost:3000.

## Using the application

Add a field to a form by clicking one of the add field icons. The field types available are:

- Text
- Email Address
- Date
- Address
- Dropdown
- Radio Select

Once the form is completed, click create form to generate the accessible form element from your design. The element's markup will be presented along with a rendering of the form in the page. From here styling can be selected. There are two available styles:

- Simple - basic styling which should not conflict with preexisting CSS rules.
- Clean - heavier styling to give forms a sleeker clean look (available in light and dark).

These style sheets can be downloaded from the selection menu.
